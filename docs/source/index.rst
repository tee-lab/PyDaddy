PyDaddy (Python Data-Driven Dynamics)
=====================================

PyDaddy is a comprehensive and easy to use python package to discover data-derived stochastic differential equations from time series data. PyDaddy takes the time series of state variable :math:`x`, scalar or 2-dimensional vector, as input and discovers an SDE of the form:

.. math::

    \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) + g(x) \cdot \eta(t)

where :math:`\eta(t)` is uncorrelated white noise. The function :math:`f` is called the *drift*, and governs the deterministic part of the dynamics. :math:`g^2` is called the *diffusion* and governs the stochastic part of the dynamics.

PyDaddy also provides a range of functionality such as equation-learning for the drift and diffusion functions using sparse regresssion and a suite of diagnostic functions.
