### Overview of the study and package

<strong>PyDaddy</strong> is an open source package which is a key contribution of the manuscript Nabeel et al, [arXiv:2205.02645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02645). The basic scientific premise for this package is to discover the nature of stochasticity in ecological time series datasets. It is well known that the stochasticity can affect the dynamics of ecological systems in counter-intuitive ways. Without understanding the equations (typically, in the form of stochastic differential equations or SDEs, in short) that govern the dynamics of populations or ecosystems, it's challenging to determine the impact of randomness on real datasets. In this manuscript and accompanying package, we introduce a methodology for discovering equations (SDEs) that transforms time series data of state variables into stochastic differential equations. This approach merges traditional stochastic calculus with modern equation-discovery techniques. We showcase the generality of our method through various applications and discuss its limitations and potential pitfalls, offering diagnostic measures to address these challenges.

<strong>PyDaddy</strong> is a comprehensive and easy to use python package to discover data-derived stochastic differential equations from time series data. PyDaddy takes the time series of state variable $x$, scalar or 2-dimensional vector, as input and discovers an SDE of the form:

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) + g(x) \cdot \eta(t) $$

where $\eta(t)$ is Gaussian white noise. The function $f$ is called the _drift_, and governs the deterministic part of the dynamics. $g^2$ is called the _diffusion_ and governs the stochastic part of the dynamics.

PyDaddy also provides a range of functionality such as equation-learning for the drift and diffusion functions using sparse regresssion, a suite of diagnostic functions, etc..

### Getting Started Without Package Installation

We provide a number of easy to use scripts for the ease of learning and using the package, and with an aim that our manuscript is easily reproducible. 

First, we emphasise that PyDaddy can be executed online on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), without having to install it on your local machine. To run PyDaddy on Colab, open a notebook on Colab. Paste the following code on a notebook cell and run it:

    %pip install git+https://github.com/tee-lab/PyDaddy.git

This sets up PyDaddy in the notebook environment.

### Example Scripts/Jupyter Notebooks
There are several <strong>example scripts / Jupyter notebooks</strong> provided, which can be used to familiarize yourself with various features and functionalities of PyDaddy. These can be executed on Colab. In the list below, we mention the path to location of each notebook as well as a link to the google colab notebook; the latter does not require installing either python or package on your system. 

- <strong>Notebook 1</strong> (<strong>notebooks/1_getting_started.ipynb</strong>): [Getting started with scalar data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/1_getting_started.ipynb): Introduction to the basic functionalities of PyDaddy, using a 1-dimensional dataset.  
- <strong>Notebook 2</strong> (<strong>notebooks/2_getting_started_vector.ipynb</strong>): [Getting started with vector data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/2_getting_started_vector.ipynb): Introduction to the basic functionalities of PyDaddy on 2-dimensional datasets. 
- <strong>Notebook 3</strong> (<strong>notebooks/3_advanced_function_fitting.ipynb</strong>): [Advanced function fitting](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/3_advanced_function_fitting.ipynb): PyDaddy can discover analytical expressions for the drift and diffusion functions. This notebook describes how to customize the fitting procedure to obtain best results. 
- <strong>Notebook 4</strong> (<strong>notebooks/4_sdes_from_simulated_timeseries.ipynb</strong>): [Recovering SDEs from synthetic time series](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/4_sdes_from_simulated_timeseries.ipynb): This notebook generates a simulated time series from a user-specified SDE, and uses PyDaddy to recover the drift and diffusion functions from the simulated time series. 
- <strong>Notebook 5</strong> (<strong>notebooks/5_exporting_data.ipynb</strong>): [Exporting data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/5_exporting_data.ipynb): Demonstrates how to export the recovered drift and diffusion data as CSV files or Pandas data-frames. 
- <strong>Notebook 6</strong> (<strong>notebooks/6_non_poly_function_fitting.ipynb</strong>): [Fitting non-polynomial functions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/6_non_poly_function_fitting.ipynb): PyDaddy fits polynomial functions to drift and diffusion by default. This behaviour can be customized, this notebook illustrates how to do this.
- <strong>Notebook 9</strong> (<strong>notebooks/9_higher_dimensions.ipynb</strong>): [Demonstration with a 3-dimensional system] An example to demonstrate that, in principle, the method of stochastic equation discovery can be extended to higher dimensions. 

(See below for Notebooks 7 and 8).

### Real datasets and Scripts/Jupyter Notebooks
There are also two notebooks that use PyDaddy to discover SDEs from real-world datasets.

* <strong>Fish Schooling Dataset </strong> (<strong>pydaddy/data/fish_data/ectroplus.csv</strong>): The fish  dataset contains the 2D polarisation vector time series of a fish school (15 fish). Two columns in the csv file represent the x- and y-components of the polarisation vector, respectively and each row corresponds to a time stamp, with consecutive rows separated by a time frame of 0.04 seconds. The full dataset is available at a previously published repository: https://zenodo.org/records/3632470. For more details about the dataset, see (Jhawar et. al., Nature Physics, 2020)[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-0787-y].
   * <strong>Notebook 7</strong> (<strong>notebooks/7_example_fish_school.ipynb</strong>): [Example analysis - fish schooling](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/7_example_fish_school.ipynb): An example analysis of a fish schooling dataset from [Jhawar et. al., Nature Physics, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-0787-y) using PyDaddy. 

* <strong>Cell Migration Dataset </strong> (<strong>pydaddy/data/cell_data/trajectories_x_pattern5.txt</strong>): The confine cell migration dataset contains tracked trajectories of 149 cells, tracked for upto 300 time steps each, with one data point every 15 minutes. The data is provided as a plain text file. Each row corresponds to the time series of one cell, with each column corresponding to the cell x-position (in micrometer units). For more details about the dataset, see (Brückner et. al., Nature Physics, 2019)[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0445-4]. 
   * <strong>Notebook 8</strong> (<strong>notebooks/8_example_cell_migration.ipynb</strong>): [Example analysis - cell migration](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/8_example_cell_migration.ipynb): An example analysis of a confined cell migration dataset (Brückner et. al., Nature Physics, 2019)[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0445-4] using PyDaddy.
