## Overview of the study

From the <strong>Abstract</strong> of the manuscript:  

Theoretical studies have shown that stochasticity can affect the dynamics of ecosystems in counter-intuitive ways. However, without knowing the equations governing the dynamics of populations or ecosystems, it is difficult to ascertain the role of stochasticity in real datasets. Therefore, the inverse problem of inferring the governing stochastic equations from datasets is important. 

Here, we present an equation discovery methodology that takes time series data of state variables as input and outputs a stochastic differential equation. We achieve this by combining traditional approaches from stochastic calculus with the equation-discovery techniques. We demonstrate the generality of the method via several applications. 

First, we deliberately choose various stochastic models with fundamentally different governing equations; yet they produce nearly identical steady-state distributions. We show that we can recover the correct underlying equations, and thus infer the structure of their stability, accurately from the analysis of time series data alone. We demonstrate our method on two real-world datasets – fish schooling and single-cell migration – which have vastly different spatiotemporal scales and dynamics. We illustrate various limitations and potential pitfalls of the method and how to overcome them via diagnostic measures. Finally, we provide our open-source codes via a package named <strong>PyDaDDy: Python library for Data Driven Dynamics</strong>: \url{https://github.com/tee-lab/PyDaddy}.

## Overview of the package

PyDaddy is a comprehensive and easy to use python package to discover data-derived stochastic differential equations from time series data. PyDaddy takes the time series of state variable $x$, scalar or 2-dimensional vector, as input and discovers an SDE of the form:

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) + g(x) \cdot \eta(t) $$

where $\eta(t)$ is Gaussian white noise. The function $f$ is called the _drift_, and governs the deterministic part of the dynamics. $g^2$ is called the _diffusion_ and governs the stochastic part of the dynamics.

PyDaddy also provides a range of functionality such as equation-learning for the drift and diffusion functions using sparse regresssion, a suite of diagnostic functions, etc..

## Getting Started Without Package Installation

We provide a number of easy to use scripts for the ease of learning and using the package, and with an aim that our manuscript is easily reproducible. 

First, we emphasise that PyDaddy can be executed online on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), without having to install it on your local machine. To run PyDaddy on Colab, open a notebook on Colab. Paste the following code on a notebook cell and run it:

    %pip install git+https://github.com/tee-lab/PyDaddy.git

This sets up PyDaddy in the notebook environment.

### Example Scripts/Jupyter Notebooks
There are several <strong>example scripts / Jupyter notebooks</strong> provided, which can be used to familiarize yourself with various features and functionalities of PyDaddy. These can be executed on Colab.

- <strong>Notebook 1</strong>: [Getting started with scalar data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/1_getting_started.ipynb): Introduction to the basic functionalities of PyDaddy, using a 1-dimensional dataset.
- <strong>Notebook 2</strong>: [Getting started with vector data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/2_getting_started_vector.ipynb): Introduction to the basic functionalities of PyDaddy on 2-dimensional datasets.
- <strong>Notebook 3</strong>: [Advanced function fitting](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/3_advanced_function_fitting.ipynb): PyDaddy can discover analytical expressions for the drift and diffusion functions. This notebook describes how to customize the fitting procedure to obtain best results.
- <strong>Notebook 4</strong>: [Recovering SDEs from synthetic time series](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/4_sdes_from_simulated_timeseries.ipynb): This notebook generates a simulated time series from a user-specified SDE, and uses PyDaddy to recover the drift and diffusion functions from the simulated time series.
- <strong>Notebook 5</strong>: [Exporting data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/5_exporting_data.ipynb): Demonstrates how to export the recovered drift and diffusion data as CSV files or Pandas data-frames.
- <strong>Notebook 6</strong>: [Fitting non-polynomial functions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/6_non_poly_function_fitting.ipynb): PyDaddy fits polynomial functions to drift and diffusion by default. This behaviour can be customized, this notebook illustrates how to do this.
- <strong>Notebook 9</strong>: [Demonstration with a 3-dimensional system] An example to demonstrate that, in principle, the method of stochastic equation discovery can be extended to higher dimensions. 

(See below for Notebooks 7 and 8).

## Real datasets and Scripts/Jupyter Notebooks
There are also two notebooks that use PyDaddy to discover SDEs from real-world datasets.

* <strong>Fish Schooling Dataset </strong>: The fish data (Folder: pydaddy/data/fish_data) contains a subset of the fish schooling dataset presented in the manuscript. The dataset contains the 2D polarisation vector time series of a fish school (15 fish). The full dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/3632470. For more details about the dataset, see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-0787-y 
   * <strong>Notebook 7</strong>: [Example analysis - fish schooling](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/7_example_fish_school.ipynb): An example analysis of a fish schooling dataset (Jhawar et. al., Nature Physics, 2020) using PyDaddy. 

* <strong>Cell Migration Dataset </strong>: The confine cell migration dataset contains tracked trajectories of 149 cells, tracked for upto 300 time steps each, with one data point every 15 minutes. The data is provided as a plain text file. Each row corresponds to the time series of one cell. For more details about the dataset, see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0445-4.
   * <strong>Notebook 8</strong>: [Example analysis - cell migration](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tee-lab/PyDaddy/blob/colab/notebooks/8_example_cell_migration.ipynb): An example analysis of a confined cell migration dataset (Brückner et. al., Nature Physics, 2019) using PyDaddy.
